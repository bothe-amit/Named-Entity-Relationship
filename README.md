# 🍳 Identifying Key Entities in Recipe Data

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to **extract key entities** from recipe text data — such as ingredients, quantities, and cooking actions. The goal is to transform unstructured recipe information into structured, machine-readable data using Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods.

## 🎯 Research Motivation
In the culinary domain, recipes contain rich, unstructured text that can be difficult to analyze computationally. By leveraging **entity recognition and text processing**, this project aims to support **automated recipe understanding, search optimization, and food knowledge graph construction**, enabling smarter food recommendation and nutrition systems.

## 🔍 Overview
The notebook presents an end-to-end workflow — including **data exploration, text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and entity extraction**. It demonstrates how NLP can be applied to domain-specific datasets for semantic understanding.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python**, **spaCy / NLTK**  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive experimentation  

## ⚙️ Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bothe-amit/recipe-entity-recognition.git
   cd recipe-entity-recognition
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Identifying_Key_Entities_Recipe_Data_AmitBothe.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize extracted entities.

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Extracted structured data from unstructured recipe text  
- Identified key entities such as ingredients, units, and cooking methods  
- Demonstrates the application of NLP for real-world data enrichment
